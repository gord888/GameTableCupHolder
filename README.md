More details are available on thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4534131/



This is a slick looking customizable cup holder.  It was designed after some other examples i've seen for board game tables, and made to be easily printable.  You can customize it as you'd like for your needs, but note that i haven't really tested it with other dimensions.

###Example STLs
The STLs attached here are what I used for my game table.  The thickness is sufficiently adjustable to work on ikea desks including the Galant and Skarsta.  Most folks will probably want to customize it to fit their table.

###Customizing
You'll need openscad to do this.

1. download all the openscad files 

1. customize the parameters in the awesome cup holder scad file

1. export and print your top and bottom plates

1. measure the length of bolt you'll need (making sure you add at least 5mm extra for the 
nut)

1. adjust the bolt length in the nut job scad file.  

1. print the 4 bolts, and 12 nuts

1. assemble like the picture

1. optionally - you may want to print the bottom plate for the cup holder.  My kids have small 
cups that would just fall through otherwise.  You won't need the bottom plate for typical drinking glasses.
